Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2024 Foundations Associate (1Z0-1085-24)

IAM - Identity and access management
Principals - entities that are allowed to interact with OCI resources, three types Users, Resources, Groups

Authentication/Identity: (AuthN)
Username/Password
API Signing Keys
Authentication tokens
Princpals
Federated Identity
MFA

Permission: (AuthZ)
Policies which can be associated with Tenancy or Compartments
Verbs - Manage, Read, Use, inspect

Two groups present in a Domain by default are:
All Domains Users
Domain Administrators - Atleast one user in the group, cannot be deleted, has one policy which gives "ALL ACCESS" to resources in the tenancy.

Compartments:
- There are containers holding resources.
- They can be multi-regional...present in all regions where you are subscribed to.
- They can be nested upto SIX levels.

Default domain:
- cannot be deactivated or deleted
- cannot be hidden from sign-in page
- replicated to all regions which has been subscribed too.

New Created Domains are not replicated to all subscribed regions.
New domains are assigned to the Selected Identity Domain region during creation.
If this new Domain needs to access resources in other regions then the Identity Domain needs to be replicated to that region

New Domain creation:
- First create Compartment
- Create Domain along with first Domain Admin details
- New Domain with TWO default groups - Domain Administrators and All Users groups are created
- Both these groups cannot be deleted
- All new users are by default added to "All Users" group

Polices:
Four keys aspects:
- Subject
- Action
- Placement
- Condition
Always ALLOWS, there is no DENY policy.
Subjects can be groups,dynamic groups,group_id_ocid, "any user" => Any user in that tenancy.
If DomanName is not provided then DEFAULT domain is implied.
Placement - This is where you are allowing the Subject to perform an action...example - Compartments and Tenancy
Only Identity resource does not have "Aggregate Resource Type"...Others like Databases, Instances, Storage and Network have Aggregate Resource Type

Policy Inheritance:
- Polices applied to parent compartments are inheretied by child compartments
- Administrators policy on Default Domain is not changeable or deletable.

TBAC - Tag based access control
- Requestor - Groups,Dynamic Groups, Compartments - "request.princpal.group.tag.<namespace>.tag"
- Target - Resource, Compartment = "target.resource.tag.<namespace>.tag", "target.resource.compartment.tag.<namespace>.tag"

All OCI services support:
- request.princpal.group
- request.princpal.compartment
- target.resource.compartment.tag

No all resources support:
- target.resource.tag

Princpal - Identity of caller trying to access resource
User - 
Instance - 
Service - 
Resource - Infrastructure, Stacked, Ephemeral
Infrastructure Principal - Resource that is authorized to be a actor that can make a request to another resource...eg.Birth Certificate
Stacked Princpal - A service that make a calls to another resource and control it...eg. Database service
Ephemeral Principal - Injected identifiers, service identifies who is the holder of a resource for a short period of time....eg: Oracle Function

Dynamic Groups need matching rules, which states what type of resource become part of that group dynamically. Eg: Instance resource during add/removal


Compute Instance Placement:
- On Demand Capacity
- Preemptible Capacity
- Capacity Reservation
- Dedicated Host
- Computer Cluster


PAYE to Pay for what you Consume model.(Consumption Based)

OCI Data Migration:
Data Transfer Disk
Data Transfer Appliance
Storage Gateway

Object Storage:
Hot, Intermediate(Min Ret 60days) , Archive(Min Ret 90days) 

OCI CLI:
oci os bucket create --compartment-id ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaa2jpt4nrjosjuldzwgl6ynspzz6zpd5befm5l6jil4dlyayejw3zq --name arch_bucket --namespace-name lrvvlq6e320n --storage-tier archive
oci os object put -bn ociaabucket-cloudshell -ns lrvvlq6e320n --file I:\ISO_Images\linux-lite-7.2-64bit.iso ==> Multipart Upload
oci os object list -bn ociaabucket-cloudshell -ns lrvvlq6e320n ==> List Objects in Bucket
allow service objectstorage-uk-london-1 to manage object-family in compartment ProdComp

Block Volume Tiers:

DFS - NFS, SMB(Server Messaging Block)

Infrastructure Protection:
DDoS Protection
Network Security Protocol
Virtual Firewalls
Filter Malicious web traffic

IAM:
MFA, User/Password, Fedaration, Audit

OS/Workload Protection:

Detection and Remediation:
Cloud Guard
Security Zones
Threat Intelligence
Vulnerability Scanning

Cloud Guard must be enabled before enabling security zones
Security Zone are part of the tenancy where Security cannot be avoided.
Security Zones are applied on Compartments.

Secrets:
Passwords
Certificates
SSH-Keys
Auth Tokens

VCN:
Securty - Security Lists, NSG(NW security group)
Difference between two:
SL - Subnets...upto FIVE
NSG - VNIC....upto FIVE

Gateways:
IGW
NAT GW
Service GW
DRG

Subnets are created public or private, once created cannot be changed.

NAT GW supports - ICMP, TCP, UDP traffic
NAT GW external IP is epheremal or reserved IP

OSN - Oracle Services Network
Has reserved Public IP address
